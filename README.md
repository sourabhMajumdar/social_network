# This is a social network clone modified for K12 students.

Even today, school systems (especially in India) have shyed away from embracing the digital technologies.

We have some solutions like Moodle / Blackboard but they are often not enough (they are usually a repository of assignments)

We aim to make this website a more social place where students can learn from each other and collaborate.

We use AI (Azure Text-Analytics) to filter out negative posts.

At this point only the administrator of the site has the privelege to create a class hence no random student can create his own class.

In future we will be adding more AI functionality to this site to help students prepare for exams and understand their study material better.

This is primarily built on Django
